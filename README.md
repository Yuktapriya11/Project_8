This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset using a Decision Tree Classifier. The project involves several key steps, including loading and preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, training the model, tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, and evaluating the model using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The dataset used, fraud_detection.csv, contains 100 transaction records with transaction ID, amount, type (credit or debit), and a fraud indicator.

The project includes three main files: the dataset file fraud_detection.csv, the Python code file fraud_detection_model.py containing the complete implementation, and a project report summarizing the approach, results, and recommendations. To run the project, ensure Python 3.x is installed and the required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) are available. Place fraud_detection.csv in the same directory as the Python code, then execute the script by running python fraud_detection_model.py in the terminal or command prompt. The program will output key results, including missing value checks, the best hyperparameters selected by GridSearchCV, the confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and a plot showing the feature importance.

The model achieved an accuracy of around 95%, with a precision of 100%, recall of 75%, and F1-score of 86% on the test data. The report also includes recommendations for improving fraud detection, such as adding more features like merchant ID or transaction location, increasing the dataset size, and exploring more advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost. This project provides a solid foundation for a fraud detection system and demonstrates effective use of decision trees and model tuning to improve predictive performance.
